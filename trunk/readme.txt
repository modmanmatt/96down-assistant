== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the SO Dashboard Feed Widget plugin also work on WordPress Multisite? =
For now it doesn't for reasons I do not know yet, but I'm looking into. If you want to use something similar for WordPress Multisite, you can download the [SO Multisite Dashboard Feed Widget](http://wordpress.org/plugins/multisite-dashboard-feed-widget/) that I developed a while back and which is also compatible with the latest version of WordPress.
